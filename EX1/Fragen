How does the KNN algorithm make the predictions on the unseen dataset?
- it sorts the distances in ascending order
- it stores the K neatest points from the training dataset
- it calculates the test point to all points in the training set and stores them
- it assigns the class with the highest proportions
+ all of the above

What does the K in KNN Algorithm stand for?
+ it represents the number of nearest neighbours that are used to predict the label.
- it represents the number of hyperparameters that are supposed to be tuned.
